# Test_Charts

I made a small app to help me understand some charting items like:

   - Scroll

   - Zoom

   - Goto Points


Over time if I need something else I will add it.

Open the app, click on the fill button and it will start with some random data and show zoo to the 1st 100 points of 3000. At the bottom of chart is a scrollbar and on left of it is back button to go to the previous stage.

To ZOOM put mouse into chart and with left button down drag the mouse over what you want to zoom into.

To Goto (also Zooms) put the min and max values into the box and it will take you there. It does not matter which box ix min and which is max as teh code will sort them into min and max.
